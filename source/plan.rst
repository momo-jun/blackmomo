Heading1
===============
That has a paragraph about a main subject and is set when the '='
is at least the same length of the title itself.

Heading2
----------------
Subtitles are set with '-' and are required to have the same length 
of the subtitle itself, just like titles.

Lists can be unnumbered like:

 * Item 1
 * Item 2

Or automatically numbered:

 #. Item 1
 #. Item 2

Inline Markup
-------------
Words can have *emphasis in italics* or be **bold** and you can define
code samples with back quotes, like when you talk about a command: ``sudo`` 
gives you super user powers!
